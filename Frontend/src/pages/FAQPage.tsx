                answer: "Our courses are open to students, graduates, and working professionals from any background. While a basic understanding of computers is helpful, we start all our training from the fundamentals to ensure everyone can follow along."
            },
            {
                question: "Do I need a technical background to join?",
                answer: "No! We specialize in training students from non-IT backgrounds (B.Com, B.Sc, BBA, etc.) and transforming them into IT professionals. Our curriculum is designed to bridge the gap between non-tech education and IT industry requirements."

                question: "Do I need to bring my own laptop?",
