                answer: "Our courses are open to students, graduates, and working professionals from any background. While a basic understanding of computers is helpful, we start all our training from the fundamentals to ensure everyone can follow along."
            },

                question: "Do I need a technical background to join?",

                question: "Do I need to bring my own laptop?",
